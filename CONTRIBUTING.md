# Contributing to the Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! To ensure that the contribution process is smooth and transparent for everyone, we've created some basic guidelines.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for a new feature, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/KassandraFinance/kassandra-application/issues). Before creating a new issue, make sure that:

1. The issue hasn't already been reported. Check if there is an open issue similar to yours.
2. You include a clear title and a detailed description of your issue.
3. If possible, provide steps to reproduce the problem, code examples, or screenshots.

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

If you would like to contribute code to this project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a **branch** for your change (`git checkout -b my-change`).
4. Make your changes and **commit** (`git commit -m 'My change'`).
5. **Push** your branch to your fork (`git push origin my-change`).
6. Open a **Pull Request** on the original repository.

### Commit Message Guidelines

We use `git-commit-msg-linter` to ensure that all commit messages follow a consistent format. This helps us maintain a clear and understandable project history.

Please follow these guidelines for commit messages:

1. **Format**: Use the format `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. For example: `feat(login): add login form validation`.
2. **Types**: Common types include:
   - `feat`: A new feature
   - `fix`: A bug fix
   - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
   - `refactor`: Code refactoring (neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature)
3. **Scope**: The part of the codebase your change affects (e.g., `login`, `api`, `docs`).
4. **Subject**: A short description of the change, in the imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix").

You can find more details in our [git-commit-msg-linter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-commit-msg-linter).

### Pull Request Tips

- Make sure the code is well formatted and follows the project's standards.
- Include a clear and detailed description of what your change does and why it is necessary.
- If possible, reference any related issues in your PR.
